### Description:

While fooling around with spirograph code, I accidentally put in a wrong
angle that shot out into nowhere. This caused me to think, what if I meant to
do that? So, I loaded in some random angles and that was cool for a bit. Then
I got to thinking what if there was minimal randomness on every angle in the
arc. This generates some clustery type effects. Then I added it to the spikes
and got a pretty nifty effect. That is where it is right now.

### To do
Make sliders for the colors, arc, scale and spike
Make a toggle and slider for slew
Waste about a bajillion more hours making:

Circles,
She's spinning me around in circles, again,
Oh that skinny blonde girl, 
Something about the ages,
I failed college algebra, again.
Whoah, that skinny blonde girl.

She took me to different places
Like the university bookstore.
And the financial aid office
And I had to borrow her parking pass
Working on the night staff
At the computer lab
I totally found out her screen name.
Oh that skinny blonde girl
And the circles and the ages.
